Thanks for nice photo for free to [Михаил Павленко](https://unsplash.com/@pavlenko) from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

I am enthusiast about programming language Python. And at the moment most of the free time I am learning Python.

But I liked Julia, cybersecurity,
cryptoworld, data-analysis, UNIX OS and Linux distros also. So when I've found some extra time I am trying to study these also.

I am writing about my snail journey through these technology as absolutely beginner.
These articles help me also as a feedback when I forget what I've already learnt on my
slow journey. Articles showed me how much I moved with my knowledge.
