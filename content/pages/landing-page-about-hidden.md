Thanks for nice photo for free to [Михаил Павленко](https://unsplash.com/@pavlenko) from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

I am enthusiast about programming language Python, so I learn Python at most of my free time.

My other favorite IT technologies are Julia, cybersecurity,
cryptoworld, data-analysis, UNIX OS and Linux distros. So when I've found some extra time I am trying to study these also.

I am writing about my snail journey through these technologies as absolutely beginner.
These articles help me also as a feedback when I forget what I've already learnt on my
slow journey. Articles show me how much I've moved with my knowledges.
