Thanks for nice photo for free to [Михаил Павленко](https://unsplash.com/@pavlenko) from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

I am enthusiast about programming language Python, Julia, cybersecurity,
cryptoworld, data-analysis, UNIX and Linux distros.

I've been writing about my journey through these technology as absolutely beginner in slow mode.
These articles help me also as a feedback when I forget what I've already learnt on my
journey by snail steps. Articles showed me how much I moved with my knowledge.
