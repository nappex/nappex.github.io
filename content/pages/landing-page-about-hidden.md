I am enthusiast about programming language Python, Julia, cybersecurity,
cryptoworld, data-analysis and UNIX OS. I'd like to write to you about these topics.
I've been writing about my journey through these technology as absolutely beginner.
These articles help me also as a feedback when I forget what I've already learnt on my
journey through the IT sea. Articles showed me how much I moved with my knowledge.
